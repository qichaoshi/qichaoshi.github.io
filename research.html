  <b class="papertitle">Abstract</b> <br>

This study explores the interaction between a product expert, who offers to sell a product recommendation or ranking,
    and novice consumers. The expert not only has superior information about the quality of the products consumers are
    considering, but also can influence the market values of the products. Meanwhile, the expert's profit is highly
    determined by the number of consumers who subscribe the ranking publications. In this scenario, the expert may offer
    advice by ranking products in a manner that is inconsistent with consumer utility. We design a laboratory experiment
    to investigate this hypothesis using three treatments. The findings are consistent with our prediction:
    more than 70% experts have chosen a methodology that could manipulate the ranking to attract consumers.
    We employ further dynamic analysis and find that experts behave consistently while consumers would like to change
    actions responsively.

  <b class="papertitle">Abstract</b> <br>

This paper revisits information disclosure behavior with the concern of third-party product rankings. We provide another
    evidence of incomplete disclosure, which is consistent with most existing studies. Furthermore, we distinguish one
    case where a firm dominates the market and new disclosure strategies will be considered. Finally, we examine firms'
    optimal advertising strategies responding to product rankings. When firms cannot hide the quality information, they
    may have more incentive to influence consumers' preference by persuasive advertising.

<font size="4">Chapter 3: "Optimal Return Policy with Two-sided Asymmetric Information"</font> <br>

  <b class="papertitle">Abstract</b> <br>

This paper examines optimal return policies with the concern of consumer heterogeneity in return propensities. We find
    that a ``free return" policy is costly for retailers who will be better off by charging a fee for returned items.
    Furthermore, if the seller could identify consumers with higher return propensities, he has incentive to adopt a
    discriminatory return policy.
