<font size="4">Chapter 1: "An Experimental Study of Selling Expert Advice" (Job Market Paper)</font> (<a href="files/JMP_shi.pdf">PDF</a>) <br>

  <b class="papertitle">Abstract</b> <br>

This study explores the interaction between a product expert, who offers to sell a product ranking, and its intended audience
    -- a novice consumer. The expert not only has superior information about the quality of the products the consumer is
    considering, but also can directly influence consumer utility of a product by the product's rank. Furthermore, the
    expert possibly collects revenue by selling its ranking to the consumer. In this setting with strategic information
    transmission, the expert may rank products in a manner that does not reflect the consumer's intrinsic utilities of
    the products (i.e., the consumer's utility of the product attributes). We design a laboratory experiment to investigate
    this issue using three treatments. The findings are consistent with our prediction: more than 70% experts choose
    to rank products in a manner that is inconsistent with consumer intrinsic utility. We employ further dynamic analysis
    and find that experts behave consistently while consumers would like to change actions responsively.

  <b class="papertitle">Abstract</b> <br>

This paper revisits information disclosure behavior with the concern of third-party product rankings. We provide another
    evidence of incomplete disclosure, which is consistent with most existing studies. Furthermore, we distinguish one
    case where a firm dominates the market and new disclosure strategies will be considered. Finally, we examine firms'
    optimal advertising strategies responding to product rankings. When firms cannot hide the quality information, they
    may have more incentive to influence consumers' preference by persuasive advertising.

<font size="4">Chapter 3: "Optimal Return Policy with Two-sided Asymmetric Information"</font> <br>

  <b class="papertitle">Abstract</b> <br>

This paper examines optimal return policies with the concern of consumer heterogeneity in return propensities. We find
    that a "free return" policy is costly for retailers who will be better off by charging a fee for returned items.
    Furthermore, if the seller could identify consumers with higher return propensities, he has incentive to adopt a
    discriminatory return policy.
