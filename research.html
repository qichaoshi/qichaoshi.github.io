<font size="4"><b>Chapter 1</b>: "An Experimental Study of Selling Expert Advice" (Job Market Paper)</font> (<a href="files/JMP_shi.pdf">PDF</a>) <br>

  <b class="papertitle">Abstract</b> <br>

This study explores the interaction between a product expert, who offers to sell a product ranking, and an incompletely informed consumer.
    The consumer considers acquiring the expert's product ranking not only because the expert has superior information
    about the quality of the products the consumer is considering and knows the consumer's intrinsic utility function,
    but also because the expert can directly influence consumer utility of a product by the product's rank. There are
    multiple equilibria in this setting with strategic information transmission: ones in which the expert ranks products
    in a manner that is consistent with the consumer's intrinsic utilities of the products, and ones in which the expert
    does not. We design a laboratory experiment to investigate which equilibrium an expert and consumer play. Across the
    three treatments we examine, which vary by the consumer's possible intrinsic utilities, we find evidence that product
    experts are likely to select a ranking methodology that involves considerable uncertainty about the final product
    ranking, even though doing so involves ranking products in a manner that is inconsistent with consumer intrinsic
    utility.The expert not only has superior information about the quality of the products the consumer is considering,
    but also can directly influence consumer utility of a product by the product's rank.

<font size="4"><b>Chapter 2</b>: "Third-party Product Rankings and Advertising" </font> <br>

  <b class="papertitle">Abstract</b> <br>

This paper revisits firms’ information disclosure behavior with third-party product rankings. We find that firms may not
    have incentive to inform consumers about attribute quality if that would reduce product differentiation, a result
    that is consistent with most existing studies. We examine the firms’ advertising strategies in a scenario with
    third-party product reviews. Informative advertising will play the same role as costly information disclosure.
    However, informing consumers through advertising a third-party is subject to a free-rider problem. Unlike informative
    advertising, with persuasive advertising firms choose to promote different product attributes. In addition, when
    firms cannot hide information about quality, they may have more incentive to influence consumers’ preference by
    persuasive advertising.

<font size="4"><b>Chapter 3</b>: "Behavioral Return Policies with Two-sided Asymmetric Information"</font> <br>
    Qichao Shi, James Dearden, David Goldbaum, Ernest Lai
<p align="justify">
  <b class="papertitle">Abstract</b> <br>

This paper examines a retailer’s optimal return policy for an environment in which consumers are heterogeneous in return
    propensities. An optimal return policy needs to deal with a two-sided asymmetric information problem between sellers
    and consumers. When making a purchase decision, particularly for on-line shopping, consumers usually do not have
    complete information about a product attribute concerning quality, texture, or fit. In such cases, a liberal return
    policy could increase consumer expected utility by reducing risk. However, it also leads to return fraud or abuse.
    For example, if it is costless for customers to order multiple shoes to test sizes, they may do so. With free returns,
    sellers need to bear a big cost if they lack of such information about costumers’ return behavior. As a result,
    a generous return policy might only increase the amount of orders but not profits. If the seller could identify
    consumers with higher return propensities, he may have incentive to adopt a discriminatory restrictive return policy,
    possibly barring some consumers from return products.
