<font size="4"><b>Chapter 1</b>: "An Experimental Study of Selling Expert Advice" (Job Market Paper)</font> (<a href="files/JMP_shi.pdf">PDF</a>) <br>

  <b class="papertitle">Abstract</b> <br>

This study explores the interaction between a product expert, who offers to sell a product ranking, and a novice consumer.
    The consumer considers acquiring the expert's product ranking not only because the expert has superior information
    about the quality of the products the consumer is considering and knows the consumer's intrinsic utility function,
    but also because the expert can directly influence consumer utility of a product by the product's rank. There are
    multiple equilibria in this setting with strategic information transmission: ones in which the expert ranks products
    in a manner that is consistent with the consumer's intrinsic utilities of the products, and ones in which the expert
    does not. We design a laboratory experiment to investigate which equilibrium an expert and consumer play. Across the
    three treatments we examine, which vary by the consumer's possible intrinsic utilities, we find evidence that product
    experts are likely to select a ranking methodology that involves considerable uncertainty about the final product
    ranking, even though doing so involves ranking products in a manner that is inconsistent with consumer intrinsic
    utility.The expert not only has superior information about the quality of the products the consumer is considering,
    but also can directly influence consumer utility of a product by the product's rank.

<font size="4"><b>Chapter 2</b>: "Third-party Product Rankings and Advertising" </font> <br>

  <b class="papertitle">Abstract</b> <br>

This paper revisits information disclosure behavior with the concern of third-party product rankings. We provide another
    evidence of incomplete disclosure, which is consistent with most existing studies. Furthermore, we distinguish one
    case where a firm dominates the market and new disclosure strategies will be considered. Finally, we examine firms'
    optimal advertising strategies responding to product rankings. When firms cannot hide the quality information, they
    may have more incentive to influence consumers' preference by persuasive advertising.

<font size="4"><b>Chapter 3</b>: "Optimal Return Policy with Two-sided Asymmetric Information"</font> <br>
    Qichao Shi, James Dearden, David Goldbaum, Ernest Lai
<p align="justify">
  <b class="papertitle">Abstract</b> <br>

This paper examines optimal return policies with the concern of consumer heterogeneity in return propensities. We find
    that a "free return" policy is costly for retailers who will be better off by charging a fee for returned items.
    Furthermore, if the seller could identify consumers with higher return propensities, he has incentive to adopt a
    discriminatory return policy.
